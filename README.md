## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Installation

1. **Install the Extension** from the VS Code Marketplace (or sideload your `.vsix`)
2. The first time when perl files are loaded, it might say "(Please wait) Indexing perl files", depending on the size of your project. This is a one time, the extension should create a `function_map.json` file under .vscode folder and use it as a cache next time it launches.

### Feature: 🐞 Using the debugger, launching perl script

1. (Only for using debugger) Ensure you have Perl installed and accessible in your PATH:
   ```bash
   perl -v
   ```
2. Create or open a `.pl` file and goto next step or, additionally, configure your `launch.json`:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "perl",
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Launch current file",
        "program": "${file}",
        "stopOnEntry": false,
        "args": "",
        "env": {
            "LOL": 1
        }
    }
    ```
3. Hit `F5` to start debugging,

## ⚙️ Extension Settings

## 🧪 Known Limitations

- ⚠️ `Webassembly.Memory(): could not allocate memory`
  - Its a problem with your node runtime, either upgrade your nodejs
  - Or, check out your `ulimit`. Further reading - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52406217/why-cant-i-construct-webassembly-memory-in-browsers

- ❌ Windows compatibility is experimental
- ⚠️ Advanced data structure rendering (e.g. y @vars) is string-parsed, may have edge cases
